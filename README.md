# Neighborhood Map
This project is a single page application that contains a map of my neighborhood. There have several markers
in the map that represent the places that are very interesting in my neighborhood. There also has a sidenav
menu that contains a list of the names of the places. When you filter the list, you will also filter the
corresponding markers in the map. When you click one item of the list, the corresponding marker will bounce
once and the infowindow will pop out. The infowindow consists a relavent wiki-article for that place and 
the title of the place.
